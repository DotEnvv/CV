Follow the steps below to easily fix a windows PC that fails to boot up.

### 1. Obtain a copy of the windows installation DVD.  
Do this, or obtain a higher version that is still structurally compatible with the particular version at fault. For example,
it is possible to use a Windows 10 setup DVD to fix  Windows 8 boot issues. Likewise also for Windows 7 with a Windows 8 DVD. 
But its not very advisable (though possible to some extent) to fix a Windows XP boot issue with a Windows 7, 8 or 10 installation DVD, 
because of the difference in bootloader file structure and other possible issues.

### 2. Insert your CD/DVD into the CD/DVD Disk Drive and boot into it.
The specific method with which to boot into the disk generally depends on the settings of the PC Manufacturers.
